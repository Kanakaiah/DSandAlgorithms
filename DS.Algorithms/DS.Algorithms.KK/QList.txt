1.  Find out if a given string is a palindrome or not. 
		Palindrome means: a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
		Please read wiki pedia for the additional details.

2. For a given +ve or -ve number, please reverse.
		it. e.g., input1: 1234 output1: 4321; input2: -7894 output2: -4987.  
		Note: please don't convert the integer to string and reverse the string, don not use character array.

3. Calculate maximum subsequence product in an array of integers
		Ex1:
		Input = 2, 4, 3, 6
		Output = 144
		Ex2:
		Input = 2, -4, 3, 6
		Output = 18
		Ex3:
		Input = 2, -4, 3, -6, 0
		Output = 144

		More details:
		First let me start with Sum.
		In a given array of integers Maximum subsequence Sum is, the maximum sum of numbers that are in sequence
		For example:
		When the input is 1, 2, 3, 4
		It's maximum subsequence Sum is 10 (i.e., Sum from 1 to 4)
		Similarly when the input is 1,-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, -7
		It's max subsequence Sum is 18 (i.e., Sum from 3 to 6). 
		Here we can't add 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 as the numbers should be in sequence. And if we add, 1, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
		Sum would be 17 which is less than 18. And if we add -7 to it, it will be 10 which is more worse.
		Sum of 3, 4, 5, 6 is returning maximum result and hence it is the maximum subsequence Sum.

		Hopefully one more example would  clear up all questions:
		2, 4, -5, 3, 7
		Here the max Sub Sum will be 11 (i.e., Sum from 2 to 7)
		Please let me know if you are still unclear on maximum SubSequence Sum


4. Matrix arithmetic operations like additions, subtractions, and multiplications.
